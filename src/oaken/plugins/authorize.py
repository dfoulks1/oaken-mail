"""Interactive authorization that outlives one request.

Gmail's consent flow opens a loopback port, waits for Google to redirect the person's browser to it,
and then exchanges the code. A client cannot hold a request open for that, so core starts it as a
background task, hands back the address to open, and answers "how is it going" until it is done.
The refresh token goes from the provider straight to the OS keyring; nothing here ever sees it.
