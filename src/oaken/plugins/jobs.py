"""Register the job kinds healthy plugins offer on the job runner.

A plugin defines ``job_handlers()`` returning ``PluginJobHandler`` values; core registers each on
the ``JobRunner`` as ``plugin.<name>.<kind>`` so two plugins cannot collide and a plugin kind is
always distinguishable from a core one. The plugin's handler is given a plugin-scoped
``PluginJobContext`` (its own config, the clock, a logger — no database, no queue, no ``Job``
internals) and its validated payload; its result, if any, is validated against ``result_model``
exactly as for a core kind. A plugin failure is reduced to its exception type, because it could
quote mail — the same rule the operation bridge uses.
