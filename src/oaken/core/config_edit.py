"""Edit one table of ``config.toml`` and leave the rest of the file alone.

The whole-file editor replaces the text. A form for one plugin cannot: it knows only that plugin's
keys, and the comments, ordering and other tables around them are the person's. ``tomlkit`` keeps
all of that, so this module takes the file's text and returns the new text, touching only the
table it was asked about. It does no I/O and no validation of the result: the caller validates the
whole file through ``Settings`` before it writes anything.
