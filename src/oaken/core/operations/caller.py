"""Who is calling an operation, and through which door.

The *client class* decides the rules: a person at the CLI or UI can confirm their own action, an
MCP caller (an agent) can only confirm by presenting a token that a person-visible proposal
produced, and ``internal`` is code running in the daemon. The class is fixed by whoever builds the
``CallerContext`` (the transport), never by anything a caller sends.
