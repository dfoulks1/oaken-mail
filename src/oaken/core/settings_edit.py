"""Which of core's own settings a client may edit, and what a change to each one costs.

The settings operations (``get_settings``, ``check_settings``, ``set_settings``) read and write
``config.toml`` one table at a time, like the plugin settings do, but only for the keys listed here.
This module is that list, in one place. Anything that changes where data lives, which port or
address core listens on, or touches security (``[api]``, ``[storage]``, token files, the model and
plugin choices) is not on it, and a client cannot change it from here.

``Effect`` says how a saved change reaches the running core:

* ``reload``  - core re-reads its configuration in place (``oaken reload``); no restart.
* ``reindex`` - a reload applies it to new mail; mail already in the index follows only after
  ``oaken rebuild-index``.
* ``restart`` - a reload cannot apply it; core has to be restarted. No key listed today needs this
  (a reload rebuilds everything but the listening socket, and reconfigures logging), but the
  mechanism is here, tested, so the day a key does, it is reported honestly.
