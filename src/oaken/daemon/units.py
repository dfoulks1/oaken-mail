"""Service units: a dependency-ordered start/stop for the composition root.

``Core.open()`` builds the object graph (construction order encodes dependencies). The *running*
of that graph — start in order, stop the started ones in reverse — is bookkeeping that used to be
split between a hand-appended ``_started`` list and a parallel name→handler dict in ``stop()``,
two things that had to agree. ``Lifecycle`` makes one ordered list the single source of truth for
both directions, so a started stage can never lack a stopper.

This module is **core-internal**: it is not exported from ``oaken.daemon`` and is not a public
seam. A second developer adds a subsystem by appending one ``ServiceUnit`` in ``open()``, not by
editing ``start()`` and ``stop()`` in two places. See ADR 0011.
