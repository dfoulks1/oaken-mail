"""Exit codes and the CLI's own errors.

The exit codes are a stable contract a script can rely on (requirement 3 of prompt 17), so they
live in one place and are mapped, not scattered through the commands:

======  ============================================================================
 code    meaning
======  ============================================================================
 0       ok
 1       error — the operation ran and failed, or an unexpected error
 2       usage — bad arguments (argparse already exits 2 for its own parse errors)
 3       core is not running
 4       authentication — a bad API token, or a provider that needs re-authorizing
 5       needs confirmation — a mutation returned a proposal and was not confirmed
======  ============================================================================

The CLI maps core's stable machine ``code`` (``OakenError.code``) onto these. The mapping is the
one place that knows both vocabularies; everything else raises a plain :class:`CliError` with the
exit code already chosen.
