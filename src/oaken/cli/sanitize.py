"""Make untrusted mail safe to print to a terminal.

Mail is data, never instructions (``00-context.md`` rule 6), and a terminal is an interpreter: a
crafted subject or body can move the cursor, rewrite earlier lines, relabel the window title,
smuggle clipboard writes, or use Unicode bidi overrides to make text read the opposite of what it
says. Any message field that reaches a TTY goes through :func:`sanitize` first.

What is neutralized
-------------------
* **C0 control characters** (``U+0000``–``U+001F``) except ``\\t`` and ``\\n``, and **DEL**
  (``U+007F``) — this removes the ESC that begins every ANSI/CSI/OSC sequence, so those sequences
  become inert text.
* **C1 control characters** (``U+0080``–``U+009F``), including the 8-bit CSI/OSC introducers.
* **Bidi and invisible formatting** code points that can reorder or hide text:
  the explicit bidi overrides/embeddings/isolates (LRE/RLE/PDF/LRO/RLO/LRI/RLI/FSI/PDI),
  the zero-width joiners/non-joiners and zero-width space, and the BOM/zero-width no-break space.

Each removed code point is replaced with U+FFFD (``\\ufffd``), so the output keeps the *shape* of
the original — a reviewer sees that something was stripped — without emitting anything the terminal
will act on. ``\\t`` and ``\\n`` are preserved because they are ordinary layout, not control.

This is for **terminal output only**. ``--json`` output is the original data, unchanged: a script
consuming JSON is not a terminal and must receive the bytes as they are (prompt 17, requirement 3).
