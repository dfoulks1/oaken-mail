"""Printing results: machine JSON, or human text that is safe on a terminal.

Two modes, chosen by ``--json``:

* **JSON** (``--json``, or stdout is not a TTY and the command has structured output): the original
  data, unchanged. A script must get the bytes as core produced them, so **nothing is sanitized
  here** — a consumer of JSON is not a terminal (prompt 17, requirement 3).
* **Human**: text for a person at a terminal. Every string that came from mail is passed through
  :func:`oaken_cli.sanitize.sanitize` first, because a terminal will act on control/escape
  sequences. Colour and tables are used only when stdout is a TTY.

``rich`` is imported lazily and only for the human path, so it never costs anything on ``--json``
or on ``--help`` (the <300 ms startup budget). If ``rich`` is not installed, the human path falls
back to plain text — the CLI never hard-depends on it.
