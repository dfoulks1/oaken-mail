"""The seam between the CLI and core: a small, transport-neutral client.

The CLI never imports core's HTTP wiring or its in-process ``CoreClient`` directly. It programs
against :class:`ApiClient`, an abstract interface with exactly the operations a thin client needs:

* :meth:`ApiClient.call` — run one registry operation (``POST /v1/ops/{name}`` over HTTP);
* :meth:`ApiClient.list_ops` — the operation catalogue (``GET /v1/ops``), which drives both the
  generic ``oaken op NAME`` fallback and ``--help`` text;
* :meth:`ApiClient.stream_events` — the SSE event stream (``GET /v1/events``), for ``oaken watch``;
* :meth:`ApiClient.health` — a liveness probe (``GET /v1/health``) used by ``oaken status``.

Two implementations exist (or will):

* :class:`~oaken_cli.inprocess.InProcessApiClient` wraps the in-process ``CoreClient``. It needs no
  daemon and no socket, so the CLI's whole command surface is testable today (prompt 17).
* ``HttpApiClient`` speaks to the running daemon. **It is a stub until prompt 16** builds the
  server; see :mod:`oaken_cli.http`.

The two results a mutation can have — it ran, or it needs confirming first — are modelled by
:class:`CallResult`, which mirrors core's own ``CallResult`` without importing it, so the HTTP
decoder and the in-process adapter produce the same shape.
